demo: https://umbcvis.github.io/classes/class-13

code: https://github.com/umbcvis/classes/blob/master/class-13/index.html

### What's new?

This demo starts with the [Class 5 demo](https://umbcvis.github.io/classes/class-05/) and

* Adds a circle on Washington DC
* Makes it draggable with [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag)
* Shows a tooltip that indicates the state when you drag the circle
* Hides the tooltip when your mouse stops dragging the circle

All of these capabilities are added with 4 short snippets of code that are described with "NEW" comments 
in the heavily annotated [index.html](https://github.com/umbcvis/classes/blob/master/class-13/index.html)
