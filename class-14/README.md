demo #1: This map of counties for the entire US is modified slightly from Mike Bostock's [U.S. Topojson](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/410820) block. And the data from census.gov have been prepared differently.

demo #2: This map shows only the counties in New York. It adds an interactive component that presents data from a second file containing population data. Run your mouse over the counties.
