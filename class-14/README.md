# Mapping review


demo #1: shows how to create a map of counties for the entire US.  This is a modified slightly from Mike Bostock's [U.S. Topojson](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/410820) block. The data from census.gov have been prepared differently for this demo.  This demo also loads some population data.

demo #2: shows how to filter all the counties except those in New York.  It also adds an interactive component -- run your mouse over the counties.
