# Mapping review


demo #1: shows how to read CSV data into a map of counties for the entire US.

demo #2: shows how to filter all the counties except those in New York.  It uses the [SVG transform attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform) to zoom in on the state.

demo #3: shows how to create a d3.map() that allows the CSV data can be queried by FIPS code.  The several lines of new code are indicated by "NEW" comments.  To see what's going on, you should open the developer console and scroll over some of the counties.
